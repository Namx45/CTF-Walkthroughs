rdesktop didn't work for some reason...

-> Autopsy 
-> Load .aut file in "case files" folder





# what is the MD5 of the IMAGE file ?
METHOD 1:
==========
-> HASAN02.E01.txt 
-> md5 in the end


METHOD 2:
==========
-> in AutoPSY
-> Data Sources
-> HASAN01.E01
-> File metadata





# What is the computer account name?
-> Operating system information
-> SYSTEM -> Name




# List all the user accounts. (alphabetical order)
-> Operating system user accounts
-> sort by "Name"
-> copy everyone without default / disabled users



# Who was the last user to log into the computer?
-> Operating system user accounts
-> sort by "Date accessed" (twice to sort backwards)



# What was the IP address of the computer?
-> Operating system information
-> SYSTEM
-> Application
-> ControlSet001 -> Services -> TcpIP -> Parameters -> Interfaces
-> it sais DHCP IP Address 0.0.0.0
-> watched a walkthrough and it said to try 2 things :
   -> look for hosts file ( c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts ) 
   -> look for an app that handles networking (in program files, etc)
->  Data Sources -> HASAN2.E01 -> find volumes of exFAT/NTFS (windows filesystem formating)
-> vol2 is boot (looking at files), vol3 it is
-> found Look@Lan in Program Files (x86)
-> irunin.ini -> text view -> strings
-> %LANIP%=192.168.130.216

-> NOTE: Autopsy creates a registry reports via tool called Regripper
-> NOTE: This requires "Injest module"
-> refrences:

# What was the MAC address of the computer? (XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX)
